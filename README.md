# MYHSAL (Metropolitan Yeshiva High School Athletic League)
As a high school athlete, I loved following my league's website and regularly visited it for updated scores and stats. However, the webste's design was a hot mess and navigating it was a notorious experience. My friends and I always thought it deserved better, and this project gave me the chance to finally make that happen.
This site allows users to explore MYHSAL Basketball teams and players, add and edit team data, and search for teams based on specific criteria. The project is built using Flask and incorporates both front-end and back-end functionality to provide a seamless user experience.
